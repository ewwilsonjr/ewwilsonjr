- 👋 Hi, I’m @ewwilsonjr
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to use Python to do sensor datalogging, using Android phones to create science instruments, coding in the Android workspace
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do simple interfacing of Arduino and Raspberry Pi with Android phones and sensors: temperature, pressure, altitude, optical sensors (linear CCD arrays, 2D CCD array optical sensors, and creating wave generators.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a solar tracker for the 8 April 2024 American Solar Eclipse ( I live in Arkansas) to photograph and and possibly measure the spectrum of eclipsed sunlight.
